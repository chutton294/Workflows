# Workflows

This repository stores workflows applied in scientific experiments.

Workflows, which may also be termed experimental protocols, or pipelines, should document every step in research conducted 
using code, from raw data to published results. The aim is to document all degrees of freedom in experimental set up, to enable reproducibility.

The aim of the repository is to store, as much as is possible, complete workflows followed in scientific experiments to 
enable:
- scientific results to be reproduced. 
- other scientists to take part in an experiment.

Thus, the repository aims to go further than providing the code modules that are used in an experiment, and document:
- how modules are linked together 
- parameters used in running different modules
- document all potential degrees of freedom in executing the experiment
- store code modules used specifically in an experiment in case of subsequent change and development.
