# Workflows

This repository stores workflows applied in specific experiments.

The aim of the repository is to store, as much as is possible, complete workflows followed in scientific experiments to 
enable:
- scientific results to be reproduced. 
- other scientists to take part in an experiment.

Thus, the repository aims to go further than providing the code modules that are used in an experiment, and document:
- how modules are linked together 
- parameters used in running different modules
- document all potential degrees of freedom in executing the experiment
